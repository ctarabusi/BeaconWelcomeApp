BeaconWelcomeApp
================

A playground to test some beacon interactions and experiments.

Strongly inspired by: https://github.com/devunwired/accessory-samples

## BeaconActivity

Simply scans for beacons and as soon as it finds one a toast message is displayed if the rssi is greater than -40db.

The toast is renewed not more often than 5 seconds
